					<p>
					I am AdriÃ  Termes a 22 year old who recently graduated from the Bachelor in Business Administration and that will do a Master of Science in Business Analytics at ESADE Business school. I love teaching and I am currently preparing for the aforementioned master, so this page is the result of that practice by showing my professional projects from scratch. Just to keep things clear, I put a link to my previuous blog, upon which I am building this idea. I hope you like itðŸ˜Š.

				<h2> The BBA at ESADE and my exchange at HEC Paris </h2>
				<p>
					This program has been my professional foundation. From good to bad moments, I can describe who I have becomed from all the experiences. The program has enabled me to travel from Paris to London, and to really have a wide perspective on the cultural differences and how to manage them, apart from all the hard skills.

				<h2> Papernest </h2>
				<p>
					Picture this: in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, I land my first job as an intern in a digital marketing department in a French startup located in Barcelona named<a href="https://www.papernest.com/" target="_blank"> Papernest </a>. A topic that is not a 100% familiar to me, and with teammates that are all French (I did not know French neither). Without a doubt, something worth telling and that is fun to remember.

				<h2> Amplifon </h2>
				<p>
					Looking for big challenges, I landed a Marketing internship at<a href="https://corporate.amplifon.com/en" target="_blank"> Amplifon</a>. The situation in there twisted till the point that I found myself with the direction of the marketing operations for the <a href="https://www.gaes.es/implantes-auditivos" target="_blank"> implants department in Spain</a> for approximately 2 months. Fortunately, my teammates were like family and helped, <strong>but I can assure that being an intern and dealing with that is not that easyðŸ˜‚</strong>.
